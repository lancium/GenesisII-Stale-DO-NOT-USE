To profile with yourkit java profiler, you can either update the current
build's configuration to run the profiler or make the change persistent
to run the profiler.

To use the profiler just for the current build, make sure the code is built
first and then add a line like this to "bin/runContainer.sh" or "bin/grid":

"-agentpath:/usr/local/yjp-2016.02/bin/linux-x86-64/libyjpagent.so"

This addition will be wiped out if you build again.

If you want the yjp setting to persist, then edit the files in
"scripts/runContainer.sh" or "scripts/grid" instead by adding the above
profiler line.  Then build the code again, and all future builds will
have the profiler line in the bin directory versions of the scripts.

Don't leave this change in place in the scripts directory on the main
trunk, or the build will break.
