Description:

Similar to the rm tool in UNIX, the grid rm tool allows the user to delete/remove resources on the Grid or local file-system relative to the current path or an absolute path. To indicate a local path, make sure to begin the pathname with 'local:'.

The following options are available:

-r | --recursive

If the target path is a directory, removes all entries recursively from that directory and so on.

-f | --force

Forces entries to be deleted (no prompting)
