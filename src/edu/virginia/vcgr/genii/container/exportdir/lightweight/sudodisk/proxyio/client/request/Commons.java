	 * be the same. This prefix is formed in this method and stored in a passed byte array.

	 * @param request
	 *            The byte array where the prefix has to be stored
	 * @param pathtype

	 * @param cmd
	 *            Byte representing the command to be performed
	 * @param path
	 *            The filesystem path where the cmd operation has to be performed
	 * @param nonce
	 *            The nonce which goes in every request
	 * @return The number of bytes in the prefix. The length of the prefix varies as it has a filesystem path field
