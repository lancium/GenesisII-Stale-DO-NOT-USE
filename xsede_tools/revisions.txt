2012 01 19 CAK:
  We have recreated the iozone and gzip tar files used by the gnuMake.sh
script because we determined that tar was trying to recreate exact file and
folder permissions from the archive, and some of these permissions did not
have owner-write enabled.  This causes a problem on fuse mounts, where the
owner can no longer modify the new folders after the tar extraction occurs.
  The new tars simply contain rwx permissions for everything, and when tar
operates on them, it does not break the fuse-mounted permission attributes
any longer.
