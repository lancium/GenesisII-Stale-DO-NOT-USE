	/**
	 * Consider the following sequence of events: 1. The client sends a "read" request to the server. 2. The server fully processes the "read"
	 * request. It reads the data from disk into memory, and it sends a SOAP response with the data in an attachment. 3. The client receives
	 * the SOAP response. 4. The client receives some of the attachment. 5. The connection fails before the transfer is complete.
	 * 
	 * Was this RPC a success or a failure?
	 * 
	 * To the low-level (i.e. AxisClientInvocationHandler), it was a success. The server finished processing the request. The client must not
	 * re-send the request, in case the actions that the server took while processing the request were not idempotent.
	 * 
	 * To the high level (i.e. RandomByteIOInputStream), it was a failure. The input stream knows that the request is idempotent, and that the
	 * response is meaningless without its attachment.
	 * 
	 * When a "read" request succeeds at the low-level but fails at the high-level, call this function. This function checks if the file has a
	 * replica which might be able to service the read request.
