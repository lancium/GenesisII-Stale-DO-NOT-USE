# Property that sets the minimum configuration for outgoing and 
# response message-level security.  Acceptable values are 
#	"NONE" : The client does not require a minimum configuration 
#		message-level communication.  (The client will auto-upgrade
#		to the level of message-level security required by the 
#		remote container.)
#	"SIGN" : Provides (for outgoing messages) and requires (for 
#		response messages) proof of data integrity. (The client will
#		often auto-upgrade as needed to this configuration to accomodate 
#		AuthZ within certain containers.)
#	"ENCRYPT" : Provides (for outgoing messages) and requires (for 
#		response messages) confidentiality.  (When set, this value
#		necessitates proper resource AuthN, which requires that the 
#	  edu.virginia.vcgr.genii.client.security.resource-identity.authn-tolerance
#		property below be set to "FAIL".)
#	"WARN" : Allows the client to communicate with resources that cannot 
#		be authenticated -->
