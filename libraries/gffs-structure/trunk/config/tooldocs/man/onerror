Definitions:

arg1 arg2 .. argn
	String of characters to be printed to the terminal if failure occurred.

Description:

Tests the result of the command executed just prior to the error check.  If that prior command fails, then onerror will print arg1 through argn to standard error and then generate an exception that stops the grid shell.  This is useful in running batches of commands, since results can be checked and cause the entire batch to be halted if an error occurs.

Example:

grid <<eof
ls /home/fred
onerror fred folder is missing or inaccessible.
cp local:bigfile.dat /home/fred/bigfile-0031.dat
...more commands...
<<eof

If the 'ls' command fails, then the batch of commands will stop after the 'onerror' check.
