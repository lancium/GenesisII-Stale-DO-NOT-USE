Definitions:

--rpcs-only         

Only the RPCIDs of any child RPCs will be returned. Mutually exclusive with --entries-only. Default is false.

--entries-only      

Only the log entries for the RPC will be returned.  Mutually exclusive with --rpcs-only. Default is false.

-r | --recursive     

The tool will recursively request the log entries/child RPCIDs for each RPCID returned from previous iterations. Currently limited to RPCs logged by the same logging service (i.e. the same container).
                    
RPCID

The RPCID for a given set of log entries. User may enter 0 or more RPCIDs to request. If no ids are given, *all* logs will be requested from the service.
