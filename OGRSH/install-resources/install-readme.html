	<H1>OGRSH</H1>
OGRSH is a software interception library (or shim) which interposes itself between a user application and the back end standard C and C++ libraries.  By doing so it is able to intercept calls made to the standard libraries and redirect them.  This enables OGRSH to give an application the illusion that it is connected to a local file system when in fact it can be connected to a virtual file system composed of many mounts of local and grid file systems combined.  By default, this particular installer will connect a <I>shimmed</I> program to an existing Genesis II net running at the University of Virginia.

<BR>
OGRSH <B>MUST</B> be installed into the same directory where the Genesis II system is installed.  When asked for the target directory, please ensure that this path is identical to the target directory used to install the Genesis II system.  If you have not yet installed Genesis II, please exist this installer and do so first.
