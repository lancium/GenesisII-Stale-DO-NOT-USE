target-rns-path 
    The RNS path of the resource whose authorization policies are to be inspected/updated 

Description:

The interactive authz tool gives users the ability to inspect and modify the authorization policy for a grid resource. Once invoked, the authz tool retrieves the authorization policy of the indicated resource and displays it to the user. The user is then given interactive menu options for:

    * Toggling the message-level-encryption requirement for the resource (disabled by default). Enabling this instructs the resource to only accept and respond with messages that have been encrypted as per SOAP XML Encryption (http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlenc-core/).
    * Modifying portions of the retrieved policy.
    * Committing the (updated) policy back to the resource. Modifications to policy will not take effect until the updated policy has been committed to the resource. 


Authorization policies for GenesisII resources are represented as access control lists (ACLs). Operations upon a grid resource fall into one of three categories: Read, Write, and Execute (R/W/X). GenesisII resources manage three separate "allow" ACLs, one for each R/W/X category. The authz tool allows users to inspect, add, and remove identities from these R/W/X ACLs using the chmod tool syntax.
