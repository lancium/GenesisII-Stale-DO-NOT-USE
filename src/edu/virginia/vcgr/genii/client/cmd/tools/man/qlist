queue-path 
    The queue path is the RNS path to an existing queue for which the user wishes to list jobs. 

Description:

The qlist command lists all of the jobs currently managed by a given queue. This command returns a reduced set of information (information assumed to be publicly available) for all jobs currently in the queue. For a more detailed list of information, users should use the qstat command which only works with jobs that the caller owns, but returns both public, and private information.
