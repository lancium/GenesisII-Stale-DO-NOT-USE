Definitions:

target-path 
    Target path is any valid RNS path that indicates an existing Genesis II resource. All Genesis II resources support the scheduled termination time mechanism. 

calendar-value 
    Calendar value is a string which indicates the time at which the users wishes for a resource to be terminated automatically. This string can either be a valid Java parseable date string, or a + sign followed by a valid duration strings (+number[ms|s|m|h|d]). It is highly recommended that users use the duration strings version of this tool as the date strings that the native Java parser understands (See http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/text/DateFormat.html) is highly dependent not only on locale, but also Java version. 

Description:

Sets a schedule for when the indicated resources will automatically be terminated from the server.
Notes

Currently, the Genesis II system performs lazy deletion of resources scheduled to terminate. This means that the resources can expire without actually being garbage collected. Resources terminated on a schedule are not garbage collected until an attempt is made to access them (after their termination time).
