Description:

Similar to the mkdir tool in UNIX, the grid mkdir tool allows the user to create a directory relative to the current directory (or the absolute path). To indicate a local path, make sure to begin the pathname with 'local:'.

The following options are available:

-p|--parents

Indicates to create all necessary parent directories as well

--rns-service

Gives the path of an RNS service to use for creation
