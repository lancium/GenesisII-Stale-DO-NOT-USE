The directory 'gffs' contains a module configuration file named after the
current version (2.7.0) and a hidden file called '.version'.
If the version changes, these would need to be modified to reflect the
new version.
Also, if the installation location is not the default encoded in the file:
  /opt/GenesisII
then that needs to be updated in the file 'gffs/2.7.0'.
