Certificate paths can be given either as relative or absolute
local file system paths (in which case it is expected that the
path will lead to a PKCS12 formatted keystore), or they can be
given as URIs.  If a URI is given, the URI may be any common URI
which leads to a PKCS12 keystore, or it may be a URI whose
protocol is rns: which then indicates an absolute or relative RNS
path leading to a Genesis II IDP service instance.
