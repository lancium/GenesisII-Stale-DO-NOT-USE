export

export --create { <export-service-path> | --url <export-service-url> } 
	[--svn-user=<svn-username>] [--svn-pass=<svn-pass>] [--svn-revision=<svn-revision>]
	[--creator="<DN-filter-pattern>"]  [--force]  [--heavy]
	<local-path> [new-rns-path]

export --quit { <export-root-rns-path> | --url <export-root-url> }

Example:

export --create --creator="/CN=Dill Pickle" /containers/khandroma_jurgis local:/home/jurgis/xsede/code/trunk /src/GenesisII.trunk

  This creates a light-weight export of the source code "trunk" from the local
file system, where the local files are owned by a unix user named "jurgis".
Jurgis has a grid container running on the machine which is linked into the
grid at '/containers/khandroma_jurgis'.  The exported source code will reside
inside the grid at '/src/GenesisII.trunk', which will offer a view into
jurgis's local folder where the source code actually resides.
  The creator flag is used because this grid user currently has multiple
identities in their credential wallet and has specified that the true creator
of the export (in the grid) should be the user known as 'Dill Pickle'.  If
that user is not found in the credentials, then the export will fall back to
using whatever credentials are actually available for the user.

export --create --force --creator="/CN=Dill Pickle" /containers/khandroma_jurgis local:/home/jurgis/xsede/code/trunk /src/GenesisII.trunk

  Identical to the first example, but the user added the '--force' flag on the
command line.  The force flag permits administrators to create exports at the
behest of other users.  When using the force flag, the creator specified does
not have to exist in the user's current credentials _as_long_as_ the current
user is an administrator of the export port type (i.e. the user has WRITE
permission on the port type).  If the user is not an admin but tries to use
--force, then the export attempt is rejected.
