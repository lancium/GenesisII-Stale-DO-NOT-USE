target-rns 
	The RNS path of a resource which implements the RNS port type. 

Description:

Genesis II grid clients maintain a notion of current working RNS. This is the path from a root with EPRS of a namespace implemented with RNS that functions similarly to a file system. The cd tool allows a user to explicitly change his or her location inside that namespace.
