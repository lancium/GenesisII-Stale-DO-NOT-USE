# key-pair PFX files, as they are not suitable for distribution.  it does
# generate a new TLS certificate for a container, so that people can
# immediately use the package to set up a new container that will interact
# with the grid properly.  if the deployment requires more certificate files
# or keypairs, they need to be added to the deployment package by the grid
# administrator or provided in some other secure manner to the user.
