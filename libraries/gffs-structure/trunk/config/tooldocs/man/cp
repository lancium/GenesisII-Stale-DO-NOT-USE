Definitions:

-r | --recursive
Copy directories recursively.

--reliable-on-local
Copy locally with high reliability by retrying the copy from the last checkpoint on failures.

--reliable (To Be Implemented)
Copy with high reliability by submitting a copy job that retries copying from the last checkpoint on failures

source-path 

An absolute or relative path in the currently connected grid RNS namespace (unless a local path is provided) which refers to a directory or file (i.e. an RNS or ByteIO resource). To indicate a local path, begin the pathname with 'local:'. 

target-path 

An absolute or relative path in the currently connected grid RNS namespace (unless a local path is provided) which refers to a directory or file, or a non-existant resource (a path for which the final element of the path does not yet exist). To indicate a local path, begin the pathname with 'local:'. 

Description:

Similar to cp in the UNIX operating system, the grid cp command copies the contents of one source file into another target file. If the target path specified does not exist, then a new file is created. If the -r option is specified, then copy directories and files. If a new ByteIO resource needs to be created in the grid environment, then the default ByteIO service on the default container is used to create it. Currently, there is no way to override this behavior without using the create-resource tool.
