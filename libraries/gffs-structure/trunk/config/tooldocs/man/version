Definitions:

version
    A representation of a software release number, which is tracked by major and minor version numbers, plus a revision number.
    For example, version 2.7.45 could represent the 45th release of the 2.7 product.
    Major versions change very infrequently and happen when there are significant changes in the product's feature set.  Minor versions change when there are important feature updates within an existing release.  Revision numbers change whenever a new release of the software is made available.
