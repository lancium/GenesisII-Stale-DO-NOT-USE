# these items are generally used in all tests.

# The installation location for the GenesisII package (client or container).
# Update this if Genesis is installed elsewhere, e.g. the installation path on
# Mac OSX is instead "/Applications/GenesisII".
GENII_INSTALL_DIR=$HOME/GenesisII

# The name of the deployment to use.  Modern (2012 and onwards) installers
# use the name "current_grid" for this.
DEPLOYMENT_NAME=xsedebeta

# The namespace variable defines what template to use for the GFFS namespace.
# The two choices currently available are 'xcg' and 'xsede'.  The older xcg
# namespace type has /containers at the top-level, and the xsede namespace
# type has a /resources folder with many intermediate hierarchies for
# containers, queues and so forth.
#NAMESPACE=xcg
#NAMESPACE=xsede

# The user state directory for Genesis.  If not set, the default will be used.
# Note that this directory should never be put on an NFS or other mounted
# location, or the grid software will run terribly slowly.
#GENII_USER_DIR=$HOME/.genesisII-2.0

# userX below should be changed to your grid user's account.

# The area in which to test.  Many junk files and directories are created
# under this path, so it should be a directory without a lot of other
# important files in it.  Note that this directory *must* be writable by
# the grid user running the tests.
RNSPATH=/home/userX/sandbox

# Path to the user identity that will be running the tests.  This needs to be
# a user that is already valid within the grid under test.  Most tests assume
# that this user is already logged in.
USERPATH=/users/userX

# Used for windows testing; provides the path to the binaries directory of cygwin.
#CYGWIN_BIN_PATH=c:/cygwin/bin

#### GFFS settings...

# The main CONTAINERPATH is used for creating export directories in some of
# the tests.  This container needs visibility of the EXPORTPATH below.
CONTAINERPATH=/containers/BootstrapContainer

# REMOTE/LOCAL container paths are used for GFFS Performance Testing: the user
# must have permissions to create files on these containers.  Note that the
# local container should be close on the network to the user (short number of
# hops, high bandwidth connection) whereas the remote container can be far
# away from the user.  The test will run very slowly over a low-speed WAN
# though, so it's recommended that the remote container still have high
# bandwidth available.
REMOTE_CONTAINER=/containers/BootstrapContainer
LOCAL_CONTAINER=/containers/BootstrapContainer

#   This is a path to export to the grid from the local filesystem.  Be
# careful because this is tricky; it must be a valid path that the container
# listed in CONTAINERPATH can actually see.
#   So, if you are using the bootstrap container for the grid, it is important
# to get a valid export path from the grid administrator that will actually be
# present on the root container's machine.
#   If you are running your own grid, then the local system user running the
# container must be able to see this export path.  Further, the permissions
# on that path for the container-running user id must match the desired export
# permissions (e.g., container's unix user should have write access to the
# export path if the export path would ever be written to *from* the grid).
EXPORTPATH=/tmp

##############

#### EMS settings...

# The queue to be used for submitting jobs.
QUEUE_PATH=/queues/grid-queue

# The group which has rights to submit jobs on the queue, plus possibly the
# right to use any BES hooked to the queue.
SUBMIT_GROUP=/groups/xsede.org/gffs-admins

# This specifies what type of BES to test.  the options are either "Genesis"
# or "Unicore" currently.
BES_TYPE=Genesis

# If this is not blank, then it is used as the only BES to target in the queue's
# resources.  This will not work if that resource does not exist on the queue.
BES_RESOURCE_OVERRIDE=

# How long to wait for the jobs to finish...
# The queue sleep duration is the interval between each queue check.  If this
# is too fast, the queue will be slowed down by the continual questioning.
QUEUE_SLEEP_DURATION=120
# The queue tries is the number of times the above sleep duration is allowed
# to occur in between seeing a change in the job count in the queue.  So if
# the sleep duration is 2 minutes, and this number is 30, then the queue has
# to change at least every hour or an error is reported.
QUEUE_TRIES_ALLOWED=60
# 60 tries is 2 hours worth of waiting for just one job to complete.

# These items are all for the file staging tests.  The arrays below hold these items:
#   hostname, test directory, username, password.
# For example: FTP=("ftp.dartmouth.edu" "/home/userX/flummox" userX GrumbleCake)

# The stage-out to email test needs the recipient address.  (It uses SCP
# parameters for the stage-in portion.)

#### multi-user settings for both GFFS and EMS...

# These arrays are needed for the multi-user testing.  Those tests can use up to
# 10 accounts in the array below.  Note that the account names must all be unique,
# and should provide the full path to the user location.
# Also note that the password list must have the correct passwords for each account,
# and must be in the same order as the account names.
MULTI_USER_LIST=(/users/demo_user1 /users/demo_user2 /users/demo_user3 /users/demo_user4 /users/demo_user5 /users/demo_user6 /users/demo_user7 /users/demo_user8 /users/demo_user9 /users/demo_user10)

# replication test settings...

# To bootstrap a second container with a configuration that is identical
# to the $DEPLOYMENT_DIR container except for the port number,
# set the container name and port number here, and run bootstrap_backup.sh.
# The script will create the necessary configuration and deployment files.
#BACKUP_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=backup
#BACKUP_PORT_NUMBER=21003

# The bootstrap script will link the container at localhost:backup_port
# into the default container's RNS namespace under this name.
#BACKUP_CONTAINER=/containers/backup

# Set the location of the runtime directory of the second container.
#BACKUP_USER_DIR=$HOME/.backup-genesisII-2.0

#### less frequently used settings...

# These items are only needed for Unicore EMS tests, where the current process
# for logging in requires a keystore login first, and then a normal user login.
