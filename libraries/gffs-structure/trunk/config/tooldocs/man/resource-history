	The RNS path to the Queue resource. This is the path to the Queue where the job whose history is required, was submitted.	

[resource-hint]
	The job-ticket of the job whose job-history is required.

Events are categorized as Default, CreatingJob, CreatingActivity, Scheduling, StageIn, StageOut, ReQueing, Checking, Cleanup, Terminating, CloudSetup. The job-history can be serialized and written to a file or displayed on the console without serialization. This tool has a minimum event-level of "Trace".
