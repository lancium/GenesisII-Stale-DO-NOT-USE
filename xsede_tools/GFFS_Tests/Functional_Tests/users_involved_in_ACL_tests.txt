unix user A is running grid container and is the one who would be granted
      access to an FS path that he does not already have.
  + this allows him to export a path from his container.

unix user B wants to add an exported path to unix user A's grid that unix user
      B has full access to.
  + unix user B runs the set_acls script to give A access.
    * should mask always be rwx?
       -> for now has to be, or ugly exceptions result on failed accesses.

admin user runs an export command at behest of grid user C,
    which unix user A's container can now do.

unix user B logs in as grid user C.

grid user C can then access files on export per the permissions granted to
    unix user A.

grid user D has no special access to the folders involved.
  + grid user D tries to do things on the exported grid path but is not allowed.

unix user E has no ACL rights to the folder involved.
  + unix user E tries to do things on the unix path but is not allowed.
