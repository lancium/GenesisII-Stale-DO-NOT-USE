Definitions:

queue-path 
    The queue path is the RNS path to an existing queue into which the user wishes to submit a new job. 

priority 
    This option allows the user to specify a custom priority for the jobs that he or she is submitting. Priorities are integers in the range [-10, 10] and for which a lower number indicates a higher priority (i.e., that the jobs will run earlier then lower priority jobs). 

jsdl-file 
    Jobs are specified by JSDL (Job Service Description Language) documents. The jsdl-file argument specified the RNS or local path of a valid jsdl XML file describing the job that the user wishes to submit to the queue. To indicate a local path, make sure to begin the pathname with 'local:'. 

Description:
