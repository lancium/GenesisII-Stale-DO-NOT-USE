Building Genesis II GFFS
========================

Prerequisites:

  Java 1.7 JDK (Oracle java recommended, available at http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html )
  Unlimited JCE jars (documented at http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce-7-download-432124.html )
  RPM Installed for: ant ant-contrib ant-nodeps ant-jsch ant-trax ant-junit
    (or Debian package for: ant)

Building from source RPM (SRPM):

(Where referenced below, {grid} and {version} should be replaced with
the appropriate text from the software package being installed or rebuilt.)

This will take the source rpm and produce a new RPM binary package:

  rpmbuild --rebuild genesis-{grid}-{version}.rpm

Building from tar bundle:

  Preparation (same for both 32-bit and 64-bit versions):
    export ANT_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx768m -XX:MaxPermSize=768m
    tar -xf genesis2-{grid}-{version}.tar.gz
    cd genesis2-{grid}-{version}
    ant clean
    # follow with either 32-bit or 64-bit build steps...

  Peforming a build for 64-bit version:
    ant -Dbuild.targetArch=64 build

  Peforming a build for 32-bit version:
    ant build
