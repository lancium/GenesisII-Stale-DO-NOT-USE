idp
	The idp option allows the user to specify the URL of an ECP-compatible InCommon Identity Provider endpoint. If this option is unused or blank, the iclogin tool will prompt from a list of known compatible IDP endpoints.

key
    The key option allows the user to specify a path to a pre-existing SSL public/private keypair file to use for the certificate signing request. The path may be on the local machine or within the RNS namespace, prefixed with "local:" or "grid:", respectively. If the option is unused, the iclogin tool will prompt for a path. If the entry is blank, a new pair will be generated automatically. 
    
csr
	The csr option allows the user to specify a path to a pre-existing SSL certificate signing request file to send to CILogon.org for authentication. This option is only available if the user also specified a keypair file. If the CSR provided was not generated with the keypair specified by the "key" option, the authentication request will fail. If the option is not used, and the keypair is not generated by the iclogin tool, the tool will prompt for a path. If the entry is blank, or the keypair is generated, a new CSR will be automatically generated by the tool.
	
Description:

The iclogin tool expands on the utility of the base login tool to authenticate to an external InCommon identity provider, then uses that authentication to acquire Genesis II credentials for the client's local context. These are the initial and secondary credential acquisition, respectively. 

Notes:

iclogin uses the base login tool for the secondary credential acquisition, so all of the options for the base login tool are also available for iclogin with the same semantics, along with the additions listed herein.

iclogin assumes that the STS for the secondary credential acquisition will be located at "/users/incommon.org/<username>", where <username> is the string provided in the "username" option or to the tool prompt.
