This script performs the top-level replication steps on the XSEDE grid.\n\
It will not succeed if it has already been run before.\n\
Note that the script is designed to be run on an isolated client, not\n\
directly on the root or root replica container.\n\
\n\
The script takes the following parameters:\n\
1) The hostname of the root replica container, where the root container's\n\
   resolver and resource replicas will be stored.\n\
2) The port number where the root replica is listening for requests.\n\
\n\
This script requires that the following environment variables are set:\n\
GENII_INSTALL_DIR - the location of the Genesis II GFFS client that is\n\
    configured to point at the root container.\n\
GENII_USER_DIR - the location where the state directory for Genesis is\n\
    located.\n\
