%description
The Genesis II Project is intended to provide the grid user community with free, easy-to-use tools to leverage grid technology to fulfill their computation and data management needs. The platform is designed to support a wide range of potential application domains from simple data sharing to multi-platform, multi-organizational high-throughput computing.
The Genesis II platform is an interoperable (via adherence to community standards), freely available, and flexible platform for developing and evaluating new grid technologies and models. Genesis II serves to vet and validate the standardization efforts within the OGF and OGSA standards communities. Grid research is a dynamic field of study, and many challenges remain. Particular areas that we focus on are data access, security (confidentiality, data integrity, access control, policy negotiation), dependability (availability, SLAâ€™s, policy languages), and grid standards.
