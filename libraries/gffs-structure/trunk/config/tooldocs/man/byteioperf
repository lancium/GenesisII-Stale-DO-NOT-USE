Definitions:

<source-byteio>
	The RNS path to the byteIO resource against which the performance test is to be performed. 

<block-size>
	The number of bytes in a single-block that the client wishes to read with a single-thread in a single out-call.

<num-threads>
	The number of threads to be spawned.


Description:
	This tool is a performance test against a byteIO resource. It aids in measuring the time taken to read from a byteIO resource as a function of the block-size and the number of threads. It helps inferring how much of the bandwidth is actually being utilized.


Example:
	byteioperf test.xml 1024 2 : This spawns two threads each reading 1024 bytes of data at a time from the byteIO resource test.xml .
